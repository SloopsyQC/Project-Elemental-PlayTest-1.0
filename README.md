## What is Project Elemental?
Project Elemental is a test demo to try out new mechanics I want to apply in a future game.
This isn't a full game and most likely won't be in the future but only serves to see if the mechanics applied in it are both functional and fun.
Your Job as a PlayTester will be to test out these mechanics to catch any bugs and make sure everything works.
Please try to play every level and by the end of it respond to the google forum.
This all should take around 30 minutes max
